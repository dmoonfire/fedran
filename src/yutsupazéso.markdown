Yutsupazéso is a courier of the [Shimusògo]() clan.

# Early Life

Yutsupazéso was a talented but non-creative courier for the clan. She was capable of running long distances and rivaled the warriors for speed, but she didn't deviate easily from her path. Even when there was danger ahead, she frequently charged forward.

When she became the clan elder, her punishments pushed the one being punished to their limits, typically with endurance. She would have the teenagers rebuilt common areas, run long distances, or otherwise exhaust them until they were unable to cause trouble.
