Tarsan is a small country which, over the centuries, has exerted a significant influence on the definition of High Society and civilization along the northern and coastal areas of the continent.

# Founding

Originally, Tarsan was the name of an alliance of seven families that banded together against a war threatened by surrounding families and city-states. It was a hasty organization, led by the patriarch of the Kasin family.

The alliance's combined resources successfully defended against their opponents and the patriarchs of the seven families decided that they would continue the alliance because of the economic and military benefits it provided.

# Families

Tarsan politics are organized by families, with the seven great families at the top of society and various branches and lesser families branching out through various relationships of blood and marriage.

Most families are patriarchal, with the eldest male becoming the head of the family. Only when there are no living males in the eldest generation will a female become head of the family. In the seven great families, they will skip a generation to avoid a female head.

# Culture

Tarsan culture is ritualistic from the highest ranking society members to the lowest indentured servant. The way of addressing each other, the times of day to perform various actions, and even the social calendar are all dictated by the patriarchs of the seven great families, as it has been for centuries.
