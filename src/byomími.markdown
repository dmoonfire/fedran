Yunujyoraze Byomími was a scholar and a poet, but most of her writings were destroyed when her ancestral home was invaded by the neighboring clans. She was known for preaching for aggressive defenses of the country and the need to build up a military to defend the clans from each other.

During the invasion, she found that she could not take another life. Her three children were murdered because of her inaction. She would later commit suicide hours before she was to come up to the council of clans to ask for retribution.

# Quotes

> The true nature of a woman cannot be found with simple questions or tests. It can only be found when her child is under the knife's edge or when she must choose between her husband and family.

Her final words were scrawled in blood of her bedroom floor:

> Actions made in a moment of unconscious reaction are worth more than a thousand lectures of note.
