I don't know about most or least capable, but I can give you two extremes.

The Puzzle King was a popular king of Kormar who was known for his generosity and guidance. He was a powerful mage, mainly kinetic which included telekinetic, a consummate smith, and generally a nice guy. While he was in power, he finished one war that his father started and kept the country at peace with its neighbors for over eighty years.

His only problem was a growing obsession with mechanical devices, something considered obscene by most of society. It started small, clockwork devices, but no one knew how far it went until the day he died and his entire castle became a living trap (think the remake for Thirteen Ghosts). Even that said, most people would say he was pretty awesome.

His children, on the other hand, couldn't find his will in said death trap, so they decided to have a civil war instead. Brother and sister fought for control, tearing everything apart in their attempt to vanquish the other. They ripped through treaties, invaded other countries to gather up more land, all in a constant attempt to prove they were the better monarch.

It ended when representatives of the surrounding countries walked in and set up camp at what would be known as Turning Point, a lovely lake near the center of Kormar. When the Silver King and Golden Queen threatened to kill the respenstives, armies were formed on the borders and camped. Not attacking, not charging, just a couple tens of thousand of mage knights and troops.

Eventually, the king and queen figure out that violence wasn't the answer. They sent representatives to Turning Point and listened. It was a promise, if the two children didn't stop fighting, the other countries would invade.

A year later, the actual heads of the countries, the Golden Queen, and the Silver King returned to Turning Point and signed a treaty, the Pact of Gold and Silver, which officially shared the royal duties between the two children with the Bronze Council (a group of appointed councilors) coordinating when the two conflicted. That was the last time the two siblings would ever see each other in person.
