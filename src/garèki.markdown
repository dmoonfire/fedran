Kimichyufi Garèki was a warrior who refused to leave his clan's ancestral home. He became a guardian and dedicated himself to protecting the clan's young while the rest of his clan waged war halfway across the desert.

It was his own clan that killed them when they found that he granted shelter to anyone who survived to reach the gate, regardless of their clan or position.
