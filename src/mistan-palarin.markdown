Mistan Palarin had little talent beyond the ability to create a small measure of water. She spent most of her days cleaning buildings and guilds. During the night, she spent most of her time reading about foreign lands and writing fantastic plays about the places she could only see in her imagination.

Despite calls of plagiarism, she was successful in the later years of her life but died without ever seeing any of the places that she wrote about.

# Quotes

> I don't wish to visit the places I've seen in my mind, for one or the other will shatter and I can't destroy the beauty of either.
