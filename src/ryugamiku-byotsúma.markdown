Ryugamiku Byotsúma was a courier for most of his life, but he had a unique way of looking at the world that soon he was deliverying his own saying more than papers and documents. He spoke almost solely of Tachìra and had the utmost respect for the sun god, despite being a member of a night clan.

When he was killed, it is said that the sun shone in the middle of the night for Tachìra to claim him.
