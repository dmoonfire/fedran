At the height of his career, Paladsaid Markon was a Third Circle Air Knight, but lost both of his legs and his right arm during a failed defense of the Butchar Pass. When he recovered, he left the [Kormar]() military branch and settled down in [Kosobyo City]() where he spent the rest of his days observing how the desert cultures raise child and how the clan warrior's sterility affects their ability to protect their families and clan.

He is known for many books, but [Rearing Children in the Mifúno Desert]() (note that it should have been Mifuno Desert) is one of his better-known collections of essays.
