Rutejìmo (Jìmo for short) is a courier of the [Shimusògo]() clan. While growing up, he was unremarkable but he quickly became one of their greatest legends.

# Early Life

Rutejìmo was the youngest living son of [Chyojímo](/shimusogo-chyojímo/) and [Hikòru](/shimusogo-hikòru/). Born after three miscarriages, he was younger than his eldest brother, [Desòchu](/shimusogo-desòchu/), by fourteen years.

A week after he was born, his mother fell when she tripped on a path inside [Shimusogo Valley](). Already weak from Rutejìmo's birth, she died from her injuries. Desòchu partially blamed Rutejìmo for her death, but suppressed it after pressure from the clan elders to move beyond it.

As normal for the isolated clan, the elders raised all children and left the clan's duties to the capable adults including his father. He moved in with his grandparents, [Tejíko](/shimusogo-tejíko/) and [Somiryòki](/shimusogo-somiryòki/).

Growing up, Rutejìmo struggled in the shadow of Desòchu who was rapidly becoming one of the favorite youths of the clan. Desòchu was faster and stronger, not to mention more personable than Rutejìmo. From Rutejìmo's point of view, Desòchu was the perfect warrior. In response, Rutejìmo became somewhat of a troublemaker, always trying to exceed his brother's deeds but failing because he didn't have the skills or drive.

Desòchu moved out of their grandparent's cave when Rutejìmo was five. Many of the elders thought that Rutejìmo's troubles would lessen, but they only increased as Desòchu became one of the clan's greatest warriors and his deeds became stories told over the fires.

There were four other children about the same age as Rutejìmo as he grew up:

* [Chimípu](/shimusogo-chimípu/): A girl about a year older than him that was destined to become one of the clan's greatest warriors.
* [Pidòhu](/tateshyuso-pidòhu/): A frail boy that was unlike all of the other teenagers. Pidòhu was more intellectual, a trait that Rutejìmo didn't respect, and he struggled more than Rutejìmo with the physical tests and feats.
* [Tsubàyo](/pabinkue-tsubàyo/): A bully that frequently butted heads with Rutejìmo. One-on-one, both boys were roughly equal but Tsubàyo frequently hung around with...
* [Karawàbi](/shimusogo-karawàbi/): A much larger and more physical boy only a few months older than Rutejìmo. Karawàbi was an able fighter, capable of beating Rutejìmo into the ground but frequently got in trouble with Rutejìmo for fighting.

# [Sand and Blood]()

By the time the events of [Sand and Blood](/sand-and-blood/) started, the entire clan viewed Rutejìmo as lazy and incompetent. He was a brawler, but didn't have a long history of winning his fights. He could barely keep up with the other teenagers and didn't have any strength, fighting skill, or talent of note.

# Relationships

* [Chyojímo](/shimusogo-chyojímo/): Mother
* [Hikòru](/shimusogo-hikòru/): Father
* [Desòchu](/shimusogo-desòchu/): Older Brother
* [Tejíko](/shimusogo-tejíko/): Grandmother
* [Somiryòki](/shimusogo-somiryòki/): Step-Grandfather
