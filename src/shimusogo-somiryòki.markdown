Somiryòki is a [warrior](/kyōti-warrior/) of the [Shimusògo]() clan.

# Early Life

Somiryòki duties as a warrior ended when he fell in battle against a clan of the night trying to save a clan courier from being ambushed. He was tortured and had both of his legs broken. It took almost a month before the clan successfully rescued him, but then the damage was done. He cannot walk without a cane and much of his spirit had been broken.

Tejíko, a courier of the clan, took him into her cave when it became apparent he was unable to fend for himself. She always had a [shikāfu]() for him and the clan allowed them to be married despite him being a warrior.
