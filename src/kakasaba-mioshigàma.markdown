For his entire life, Kakasaba Mioshigàma was viewed as a simple farmer. Despite being a member of a night clan, he said little and did nothing to place him in legend.

When he died, however, his clan found thousands of hand-written books in his home detailing sayings, observations, and rituals of almost everything he experienced.

While most of his books were burned, a few were saved and sold to collectors in other countries. Even now, a single authenticated book of his could fetch for millions, and bring the wrath of the clans on the owner and seller.
