---

One of many military essays justifying the increased military defense against [Kyōti](), *A Tactical Analysis of Kyōti Politics* details the difficulties in invading Kyōti with the symbiotic relationships between the clans. Its primary message it that a single clan is weak and overspecialized, but the relationships between the clans give them strength.

The essay was written by an organization called [Jastor]() who tried to bring a clear-headed view of military matters without letting the individual researchers be influenced by political pressure.
