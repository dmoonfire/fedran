title: Cultural Differences in Practice
---

One of the first mechanically reproduced essay, the authors of *Cultural Differences in Practice* are unknown. It was delivered to a number of scholars in seven different cities in the same night, but no one stood up to claim organizing the posting or writing it.

At the time it was delivered, many countries were on the verge of declaring war on [Kyōti]() for the their barbarous ways and aggressive nature.

The essay had a chilling effect on the votes, not for its contents but the possibility that a well-organized force of Kyōti clan members were preparing to strike of the attacks were made. Most of the countries backed away from outright declaration and nothing else came of the essay.
