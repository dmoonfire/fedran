Mapábyo (Pábyo) is a young girl of the [Shimusògo]() clan.

# Early Life

Mapábyo's original family was a group of merchants from the southern desert. On a trip through the eastern parts of the desert, they were attacked by brigands. [Shimusogo Hyonèku](/shimusogo-hyonèku/) rescued the family but her parents were later killed when the attackers continued to harry the group.

Hyonèku decided to adopt Mapábyo and brought her home, a harrowing journey since the attackers continued to attack.
