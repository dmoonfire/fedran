title: Primitive Legends of the Mifúno Desert
---

Written by [Kalem Ratenbur](), *Primitive Legends of the Mifúno Desert* is a highly biased and inaccurate review of legends in [Kyōti](). That did not stop it from being used to justify increased military conflicts against the country. Even a hundred years after it was written, it is viewed as one of the guiding documents for Tarsan policy against Kyōti.

# Quotes

> The desert folk have a quaint legend that the sun, as personified by the spirit Tachìra, is in constantly rivalry with the moon, named Chobìre, for the affections of the desert, Mifúno.
