title: The Iron King's Betrayal
---

Taking heavy inspiration from [The Snake Killer's Betrayal]() in tone but not arrangement, *The Iron King's Betrayal* is a Kormar play about the fictional death of the Iron King, brother to the two children of the Puzzle King. It was originally written by [Mistan Palarin](), but heavily modified by a score of other playwrights in its current form.
