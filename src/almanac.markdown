summary: "A collection of random tidbits of information about the world."
---

As a part of world-building, I decided to write some random tidbits of information and post them on Twitter under the [#FedranAlmanac](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FedranAlmanac&src=typd) hash. Some of these are plots I'm intending to work on, others are just fleshing out the world. I suspect some of them may change as I figure everything out but the ideas are still there.

Eventually, these will be disseminated across the rest of the pages on this site, but that may take while to write them up formally.
