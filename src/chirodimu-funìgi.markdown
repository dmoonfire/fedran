---

Chirodimu Funìgi, a talented sailor, spent much of his free time writing glorious plays about piracy and the clan's air ships. It was a partial justification for the night clan's actions, but it was also written in a pulp style that brought a steady income into the clan due to his remarkable output of popular fiction.
