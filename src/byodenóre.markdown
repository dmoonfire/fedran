Byodenóre is a courier of the [Shimusògo]() clan. He ran until the last day of his life, dying from an attack but not before delivering one final message. He was honored in the [Shimusogo Shrine]().

# Sand and Blood

In the first chapter of [Sand and Blood](), [Rutejìmo]() attempts to steal Byodenóre's ashes to prove his skills. He is caught by [Hyonèku]() and ordered to report to Byodenóre's and Rutejìmo's grandmother, [Tejíko]().

{{spoiler: Sand and Blood}}

When Tejíko found out, she beat Rutejìmo until [Gemènyo]() interrupted her.

> Rutejìmo's grandmother let out an exasperated sigh. "This is none of your business, Gemènyo."
>
> "I just wanted to make sure the screams of a little child were for a good reason."
>
> "He tried to steal Byodenóre's ashes."
>
> "Oh, did he succeed or fail?"
>
> "Failed, of course."
>
> Gemènyo waved his pipe in the air. "Then I agree, a beating is appropriate here. Please, go right ahead, Great Shimusogo Tejíko."
