A four act play written by [Basamiku Goryápe](), *The Snake Killer's Betrayal* is a tale about a slightly dim thief who is trying to steal from a band of bandits. When the bandits  accidentally kill a [kojinōmi]() from a snake clan, the thief is set up to take the blame.

The play is mostly a story about the cruel vengeance of [Mifúno] on both the thief and the bandits, none of which survive through the play.
