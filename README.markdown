Fedran
================================

Welcome to [Fedran](https://fedran.com/), a world created by [D. Moonfire](https://d.moonfire.us/). Fedran is a high fantasy world on the cusp of a new age, the Industrial Age. It isn't quite steampunk though there are definitely some steampunk influences in the world. There is also a lot of anime (specifically shōnen) in the world, both in how the magic works but also the scope of the plots and characterizations.

What is this repository?
------------------------

This repository is the wiki-like information about the world. It is used to generate [https://fedran.com/](https://fedran.com/) and functions as a repository of the underlying world, established plots, and introduced characters in the world (mostly through D. Moonfire's writings).

Why is publicly available?
--------------------------

This is a slightly harder question to answer. I'm a very open writer. I talk about where I'm going, how I'm doing it, and generally what is going on. The hardest part is *not* talking about future plots.

I also think it is a way to connect with fans. I may write something that I haven't had a chance to write up and maybe someone wants to help. Or, if there are questions that someone is curious about, plot holes that need to be retconned and the like. I think Github is a way of dealing with this. Anyone can fork the repo, make a change, and then ask me to pull it in.

What is the license?
--------------------

I'm releasing this library underneath [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). This means I'm explicitly allowing a lot of the things that fans create around a creator's work of art<sup>†</sup>. Fan art? No problem. Fan-fiction? Yeah, I don't have a problem. Essays about my characterization of women and sentient dolls? Go for it. The biggest thing is that you can't make money off it (no writing the Fedran encyclopedia without me) and you need to reference where you got the ideas.

My [preferred](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Best_practices_for_attribution) way of identifying the Fedran for Creative Commons' attribution:

>  "[Fedran](https://fedran.com/)" by [D. Moonfire](https://d.moonfire.us/) is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

† *The license takes precedence over what I say. I'm not a lawyer and have no desire to ever be one.*

What about rights?
------------------

This is probably the roughest one. Any contribution to this site, I have to be able to use and I need to use it without being encumbered by rights, copyright, or anything else. At the same time, I don't want to negate the effort by anyone who contributes.

I'm not a lawyer, but until I find or become one, this is what I'm proposing:

*Anything in this repository, including accepted contributions, are © D. Moonfire. This means I can do whatever I want with them, including edit, remove, or write a novel or movie on them.*

*All contributors will be added to the `CREDITS.markdown` file and maintained in the repository. I will also have a `credits` tag in each file where someone can identify their contribution to that page so their effort is recorded for the life of this repository.*

What I mean by credits in the file. I use a YAML block on top of every file. This is tracked as part of the file and becomes part of the history of it.
