Desòchu (Sòchu) is a [warrior](/kyōti-warrior/) of the [Shimusògo]() clan.

# Early Life

Desòchu was the first child of [Chyojímo](/shimusogo-chyojímo/) and [Hikòru](/shimusogo-hikòru/). After him, his parents spent the next fourteen years to have a second child. They had a series of miscarriages before finally having [Rutejìmo](/shimusogo-rutejìmo/). However, soon after giving birth to his younger brother, Chyojímo fell down the side of the cliffs surrounding [their home](/shimusogo-valley/) and died of her injuries.

Desòchu spent the next few years blaming Rutejìmo for his mother's death. Over the next few years, he grew more aggressive and intolerant of his younger brother. He worried the clan elders, but they were content to guide him with subtle pressure until he went through his rite of passage.

Everything changed when Hikòru, his father, left the clan abruptly. Even though Rutejìmo had nothing to do with it, Desòchu's anger focused on his younger brother and he tried to kill Rutejìmo by pushing him off the cliff below the guard post of the valley.

The elders saved Rutejìmo and realized they had to take more serious concerns for Desòchu anger. Since Desòchu was at the age of becoming a man, they took him out into the desert and abandoned him. The elders watched from a distance as Desòchu was forced to confront his own angers, find [Shimusògo](), and eventually return home. He also manifested powers of a warrior, some think because of his strong emotions.

Once he returned, Desòchu's obvious hatred of Rutejìmo had been replaced by his need to serve the clan.
