Written by [Chirodimu Funìgi](), *Queen of the Chirodímu* is a five act play about the fateful final journey of the ship of the same name. It is a rousing and popular play that touches on topics of mercy, free love, and blood everywhere. One of the more remarkable aspects of the play is the frequent use of buckets of either clear water or ink which was splashed into the audience at the end of every erotic or death scene.
