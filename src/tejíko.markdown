Tejíko is a courier of the [Shimusògo]() clan. This is known to be violent when angry and is well-known for beating children for punishment or chasing them out of the valley.

# Early Life

Tejíko always had a fascination with maps. Even before she gained her powers with the clan, she was creating maps of the local area. Later, as a courier, she documented most of the routes the Shimusògo took for their jobs and collected the results in her cave. She frequently traded maps with other travelers and soon built up a detailed understanding of the eastern desert.

She never finished gathering the maps into a proper collection. When she retired from being a courier, she started the effort but found herself spending the days going over the old memories that she was unable to finish.
