Gemènyo (Mènyo) is a courier of the [Shimusògo]() clan.

He never accomplished much in his life, but he had a talent with children. Many times when the younger ones needed a subtle encouragement, the clan would look to Gemènyo to dole out wisdom.

# Early Life

On Gemènyo's first successful courier run by himself, he was given a gift of a stone pipe. At that point, he had never smoked nor had anyone in the [Shimusogo Valley]() done so. He honored the gift and learned how to use it, quickly becoming addicted to smoking weed. Ever since, he had carried the pipe with him and only put it away when he was doing long-distance running.
