Ralador Markin appeared without records on his thirtieth birthday. He created a family with a woman he loved and had three children.

It wasn't until after his death that a book, [A Girl's Secret](), was found that revealed that he was born female and spent fifteen years trying to change his gender before marrying his wife as a male.

No one besides his wife knew of his secret until he died at the age of eighty-three, which means that he kept his secret for over fifty years without revealing the truth.

Ralador's biological family has aggressively done everything in their power to erase Ralador's existence, before and after his gender transformation.
